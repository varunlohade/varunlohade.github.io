I was always the one going the extra mile, putting in more hours than was reasonable (or likely healthy), and in the end I was replaced by someone who would work for significantly less money (This was years ago and the company has lost more than half its business since.)\n\nBy no means am I saying be lazy, don\u2019t put in effort, or anything like that. But understand that you truly are just a cog in the wheel of your workplace and that it should be a cog in the wheel of your life. So, SO many define themselves by their work and the value they bring to the table, and having a strong work ethic is great - just know that you likely see yourself as more integral than the company does and it cares about you only to the extent that you serve its purposes in the manner it wants, for the price it wants."

I work for a small business who put huge emphasis on everyone being friends and building a strong team, but it just means it hurts more when someone inevitably stabs you in the back. I'm not saying go around and be a dick to people for no reason, but it's better to build relationships outside of work or in places where there aren't any politics or power imbalances.\n\nEdit: Wow I didn't expect this to blow up and there's too many comments now for me to keep up with. It's kind of vindicating but also sad that so many people feel the same or have had similar negative experiences. For the \"my workplace isn't like this\" and \"my co-workers are my family\" people - I hope it stays that way for you, I really do, but I'd maybe read some of the stories on this comment thread and be wary. It's better to be safe than sorry right?"

The easiest way by far is to use [XOWA](http://xowa.org/) which is an application that streamlines downloading and allows more customization features to control how much you download as well as the ability to search through all the pages for certain content. The one I personally use is [Kiwix](https://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Content_in_all_languages). The size seems to vary depending on where/how you download it but ive seen as high as 89Gb or as low as 16Gb (compressed).\n\nSeems like it would be very helpful for remote areas or countries where internet is unreliable or sparse to have one of the largest databases of information available at all times."
